          <p>Hollywood still tends to portray coders as over/underweight, bespectacled, Doritos-munching, Coke-drinking
            nerds...
            I think a more appropriate characterization, though, is a wizard. Someone like Gandalf, who can make amazing
            things happen,
            and has spent a lifetime learning and refining his powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding gives you tremendous powers to do things in the world—make things fly, interact with people,
            entertain, provide comfort and care.
            The ability to write code is like magic...
          </p>
          <p>
            So come on.... Who wants to be a magician?

          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">Code, code, and code some more!</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            Write code, copy out code snippets you find, play with code, change code, try to refactor code or think of
            different
            uses for your code. The best magicians learn from doing.

          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">The sleight of hand</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            Sometimes we are so eager to do great deeds that we end up forgetting that they can only achieve their
            maximum potential
            or be possible if we have a strong foundation on the basics. Forgetting this also makes us feel overwhelmed
            by the
            simple thought of larger challenges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">Practice and Experiment</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            Even though rolling a coin on your knuckles or flourishing cards are cool things to perform, these are not
            magic tricks.
            The only thing that will make you better at performing a trick is actually practicing, observing where the
            difficulties
            of each trick reside, criticizing yourself, and experimenting with variations and approaches to improvise in
            case
            something goes wrong. When practicing coding, try to find challenges that depend on the same set of skills
            you are
            trying to exercise, that are different from the outside but similar in essence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">Observe other magicians</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            Magicians get better at what they do by finding out how a magic trick is done rather than getting frustrated
            when the
            mystery comes to an end. A good part of what makes us evolve as coders is based on curiosity and
            observation, so
            wondering how an existing solution for a problem is implemented and trying to understand its implications
            can be a very
            powerful stimulus for you to explore new concepts.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">Don't be afraid to be inventive</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            At some point in history, most of the techniques used in magic tricks also didn’t exist. When we are
            juniors, it might
            feel overwhelming to come up with new ideas, challenging the status quo. We feel as if nobody we consider
            "smarter" than
            us did it, we might not be capable enough to do it either. But thinking like this actually hinders our
            progress, so
            don’t be afraid to be inventive when you face some new challenge, don’t rely only on open-available
            solutions, and even
            allow yourself to question the existing solutions to reach for better ways.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">Unravel the magic</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            One of the most important traits of a magician is being confident that they can, and will, unravel the
            magic. Think this
            as the same way of thinking you should apply to coding, don’t see the problems you need to solve as
            something bigger
            than you, but rather see them as something that you can, and will, overcome.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="tricks-list-title">Abracadabra</h3>
          <p class="tricks-list-text">
            There is one crucial point that makes magicians different from programmers: magicians try their best to hide
            the
            gimmicks of their tricks, they try to be mysterious, and when people find out how they do the trick , it
            usually means
            that they are now less impressive, but this is not true for programmers. When you develop a solution for a
            problem, and
            later someone discovers what you do or get to the same conclusion as you, this is good, it means that more
            people
            support this idea, this is how things like design patterns arise. This is something that should give you
            more
            confidence!
